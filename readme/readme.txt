Plugin "Insert Unicode Char" for CudaText.
It shows prompt dialog for Unicode hex code, and then inserts given Unicode char into text. E.g. hex code "a0b0" gives Unicode char U+A0B0. Allowed length of hex code is 2 or 4, don't enter "0x" prefix. Note that you need to use some Unicode encoding in editor (UTF-16 or UTF-8).
